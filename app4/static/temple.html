    Pachaiamman Temple at Thirumalaivayal is located at the northeast of Arunachala hill, it has the best ambiance of all Amman temples. This temple is built amidst a lush forest area with many water bodies running nearby. This temple not only serves as a religious spot but, also a place of tranquility and serenity.
    About 120 years back, this temple was built and recently it is modified. The outer premise of the temple is adorned with 14 statues of guardian angles, even the animals which had helped Goddess Pachai Amman were revered in this temple. There are effigies of an elephant, five horses, and a dog. It is a wide belief that even today, these animals are the watching guardians of Pachai Amman. The templeâ€™s fame reached all over Tamilnadu, after the visit of Sri Ramana Maharishi.
