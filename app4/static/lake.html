    Ambattur aeri, or Ambattur lake, is a rain-fed reservoir which reaches top levels during the monsoon seasons. In November 2008, incessant monsoon rain filled the lake and encroachments on the north and south banks of the lake were demolished. It also caters to the drinking water needs of the Chennai city after Poondi and Chembarambakkam Lake.

    Ambattur Lake is one of a chain of three water bodies, including Korattur Lake and Madhavaram Lake, where surplus water from one is transported to another.
